# My vim files

If you want to see nice chars in powerline on ubuntu you have to install pached font files from here https://github.com/scotu/ubuntu-mono-powerline

If you want to install a plugin via it's git repo just use `pathogen <git-url>`.

## Todo:
- Figure out how to automate: `ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc`
